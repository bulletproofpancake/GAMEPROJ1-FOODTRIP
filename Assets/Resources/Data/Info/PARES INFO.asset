  foodDescription: 'The term "Pares" literally means pairs in English. It is a beef
    stew usually paired with rice, hence the name.



    The original recipe of
    pares came from Mrs. Lolita "Lolly" Tiu''s father. Lolly and her husband started
    their now-popular restaurant Jonas Pares House, as a carinderia back in 1979



    Pares
    can also be paired with other food such as mami and sinangag or garlic fried
    rice.
