  foodDescription: "A legend explains that kwek kwek was an accidental invention.
    \r\r\n\nThe story is that of a balut vendor from cubao who dropped her merchandise,
    and not wanting to waste the balut, she peeled off the shells, coated the eggs
    in flour and fried them.\r\n\nKwek Kwek is a hard boiled quail egg covered in
    a batter mixture of flour, water, and annatto powder.\r\n\nThe large duck egg
    equivalent is called tokneneng.\r"
