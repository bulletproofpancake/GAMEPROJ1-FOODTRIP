    text: You know, you remind me of the old man in a lot of ways.

    text: What made you say that?

    speakerName: Francisco
    text: Well, you're talkative. I'll give you that.

    speakerName: Francisco
    text: Plus you make good company.

    text: Speaking of the old man, how'd you guys meet anyways?

    text: Enteng was here even before I started workin' shifts this side of the city.
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: I came across him during one of my shifts. I'd tell him off from time to
      time but he'd greet me and all his customers with a smile regardless.

    text: Yeah, sounds like the Enteng I know, alright.

    text: To be honest, I've never liked you vendors.

    text: No matter how many times we sweep you off the streets, there'll always
      be someone new.
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: Always someone out there to replace the other. Taking up space and blocking
      up roads, always causing all sorts of trouble for us.
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: Enteng though? He ain't like that at all. He stayed away from roads, and
      always eager to see a new face and know more about them.
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: I could tell you have that vry same energy, though a bit more subtle compared
      to his that's for sure.

    text: Say, isn't it a bit harsh to be hating on us this much when we're just
      trying to get by?
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: I suppose you're right. After all, you haven't bbeen much trouble yourself
      either, just here to make ends meet.
  - order: {fileID: 0}
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: Francisco
    text: I'm guessing every other vendor out there is trying to do the same.

    text: Is that a change of heart I'm hearin?

    text: So, how about an order of pares?

    sprite: {fileID: 0}
    speakerName: 
    text: Sure, something to commemorate this change of heart of yours.
